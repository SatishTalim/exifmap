This is a introductory level project wherein we build a command-line Ruby app that extracts the geo data, namely latitude and longitude, from a given image and then shows the location where the image was snapped, on a map.

1. The Google Geocoding API - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/
2. Google Street View Image API - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/index
